IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE ABOUT CONTROLLER FILES



1. In order to make your controller files clean, you can put some of the functionality that your controller is supposed to do 
inside your model instead as either a static function on the model, or a method that will be on the model object. For example,
before saving a newly created user document, you want to encrypt the password. Instead of performing the encryption in the controller file,
you can put do this as a 'pre' mongoose hook inside the User model. This helps to make the controller file clean.
