IMPORTANT thing to know about the concept of 'resource routers'.
In order for them to work effeciently, your route paths must follow strictly the REST route naming convention and specification.

An example to explain what I mean.

In the bootcamps route, we have something like this

router.use('/:bootcampId/courses', courseRouter)

What that means is that, when the route '/api/v1/bootcamps/:bootcampId/courses' is visited, it should be handled by the courseRouter.
Now, in the course router file, the route which handles requests to '/' i.e '/api/v1/courses/' will be fired depending on the method of the request, be it a GET or POST request.
Why is it that the '/' route in the course router is what will be fired? This is so because the '/:bootcampId/courses' route ends in '/courses' and as such, inside the course router file,
the route handler for '/'(which is the same as '/courses/) will be fired.
